# Challenge Data Directory

This directory contains configuration files for the **Step 2: Repository Investigation** challenge.

## For Students

Students completing Step 1 will receive a clue directing them to find the `challenge-config.json` file in this directory as part of their GitHub repository exploration challenge.

## File Purpose

- **challenge-config.json**: Shared configuration file that all students should find and copy
- Students must paste the contents of this file to complete Step 2
- This teaches repository navigation and file discovery skills

## Educational Goals

Step 2 teaches students:

- Git/GitHub repository navigation
- File structure exploration
- Configuration file management
- Real-world development workflows

## Implementation

- ✅ **One shared file** instead of 90 individual files
- ✅ **Much easier to maintain** and update
- ✅ **Realistic approach** - config files are typically shared in real projects
- ✅ **Same educational value** - students still learn repository exploration
